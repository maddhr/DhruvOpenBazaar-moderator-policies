## Summary

In order for OpenBazaar to perform transactions efficiently, a Moderator plays a crucial role in establishing trust and alleviating risk to both the buyer and seller. A Moderator has the responsibility of facilitiating the resolution of disputes and also carries the responsibility of allowing funds be transferred in situations when resolutions between parties is not possible. 

As a moderator, my main aim is to ensure seamless and quality resolution of disputes. In choosing me as a moderator, you can be assured that any dispute will be resolved based on the terms of the contract. If the dispute lies outside of the agreed upon terms, the original terms of contract will be supplemented (but not replaced) by my own policies, which are summarized below. For a more detailed explanation, please read the General Policies of the contract after the summary. 

Scenario | Result
--- | ---
Buyer agrees to shipping with no tracking | It's not the vendor's fault if the package doesn't arrive. It is the buyer's responsibility to choose to receive tracking information on the product.
Tracking status doesn't change for 10 days or the package is listed as lost | The buyer is refunded.
The vendor doesn't ship the item on time | The vendor has two days to prove shipment, or the buyer is refunded.
Cancelations and returns | The terms must be agreed upon in advance, not after the sale. Once the buyer and seller have agreed on a sale, it is final. 
Returns shipping cost | Unless vendor has violated an agreement, return shipping cost will be at the expense of the buyer.
Damaged goods | The person who shipped the item is responsible. 
Vendor ships the wrong item | The buyer is refunded and is not responsible for returning the incorrect item.
No contact in 3 business days | Your position in the dispute is voided.
Privacy concerns | I will never divulge information to a third party. Any and all information relating to the transaction will be between the buyer, seller and me. 
Illegal transactions | A contract is a contract. I don't verify legality.

## General Policies

### Shipping

The buyer and vendor should agree in advance as to how the order will be delivered and tracked. 

- If no tracking is used, the vendor will not be responsible if the item is never received. 
- If tracking is used, but the tracking status does not change for 10 business days, or the package is listed as lost, the vendor will be responsible for refunding the buyer.

### Cancelations and returns

The terms for cancelling an order or returning an item (including shipping costs) should be agreed upon before sale. Lacking an agreement, all sales are final, and any return shipping costs will be at the expense of the buyer. 

- All complaints concerning the quality of the item will be judged based on the vendor's return policy.
- If reasonable proof is provided that the vendor shipped the wrong item, funds will be returned to the buyer, and the buyer will not be responsible for returning the incorrectly shipped item. 
- If the vendor does not ship the item 2 days following the maximum estimated time provided to the buyer, funds will be returned to the buyer after confirmation from the vendor that the item was not shipped.

### Damaged items

The party who ships the item (whether the vendor or the buyer for a return) should assure proper packaging so that the item is not damaged during transport. Proper insurance should be acquired, and damaged goods will be considered the fault of the person shipping the item. If buyer receives Damaged items, the return of damaged product will be assessed based on the seller's return policy prior to sale. If no agreement found for instances on Damaged items, the buyer will not be responsible for returning product and will be refunded. 

### Digital goods and services

Transactions that involve services or the delivery of digital goods should provide a means of verifying that the service or content was in fact rendered or delivered. It is the buyer's responsibility to verify that the digital good is delivered. All information required to prove contract fulfilment must be included within the transaction. If no such verification process was agreed upon, the vendor will not be responsible if there is a dispute.

## The Arbitration Process

### Disputed transactions

A thorough investigation will be consucted in cases of disputes. Funds will be released only at the end of the investigation. Both the buyer and vendor will be contacted twice, allowing ample opportunity to determine the details of the dispute.

A reasonable effort will be made towards finding a mutually agreed upon resolution. If no such resolution is possible, I will return funds based on my assessment of the facts. In most cases, as the result of a breach of contract, one party will be sided with and all funds will be returned to that party. When it is not possible to determine with certainty the factual basis of the dispute, the funds will be split between the two parties in proportion to my assessment of the likelihood of each party's case.

### Buyer fails to release funds

If the buyer fails to release funds 48 hours following delivery of the item, I will contact the buyer using all available forms of communication. If a response is not received within 3 additional days, funds will be released to the vendor. 

### No contact from buyer or vendor

If the buyer or vendor does not respond to the moderator within 3 days, their position in the dispute will be considered void. Most disputes should be resolved within a maximum of three days, but it is acknowledged that personal commitments may sometimes interfere with either the buyer or seller responding in a timely manner. If asked, and if provided a reasonable explanation, under rare circumstanes I will extend all deadlines by up to one week. 

## Moderator Timeliness

The buyer and seller should be aware that I might not reside in their time zone. I will strive to respond to all inquiries within 8 hours, but you should allow up to 12 hours to receive a response. In rare cases, such as when I am traveling internationally, it may take me 24 hours to respond.

## Privacy and Legality

The moderator will under no circumstance divuldge the private information in an OpenBazaar contract to a third party. If, for debugging reasons, it is necessary to contact the developers (or another form of support group) and provide technical details concerning the transaction, this will be done only with the consent of both the buyer and vendor.

No attempt will be made to determine the legality of any transaction. All transactions will be treated as a contract between two responsible individuals. If contacted by law enforcement, no private information will be divulged. My main concern will solely be on the efficient and smooth transaction of goods

## Unethical Transactions

If I find a transaction to be unethical, I will take no action in the arbitration of the dispute. If you find this policy ambiguous or have any questions, please contact me before choosing me as a moderator.
